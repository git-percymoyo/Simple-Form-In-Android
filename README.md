Simple-Form-In-Android
======================

This small project demonstrates how to create a simple form in Android, pass data between two Activities, concatenate strings in Java
and having the navigation Back-button to go back to the previous Activity. The form will not submit if it is empty with the exception of the 
checkbox as optional. There really should be a dialog box to inform the user that the form is incomplete but I decided to leave the project 
as is. This project runs on Android 4.2.
