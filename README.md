Simple-Form-In-Android
======================

This small project that demonstrates how to create a simple form in Android, pass data between Activities and having the navigation Back-button.
The form will not submit if the form is empty with the exception of the checkbox as optional. There really should be a dialog box to inform the
user that the form is incomplete but I decided to leave the project as is. This project runs on Android 4.2.
